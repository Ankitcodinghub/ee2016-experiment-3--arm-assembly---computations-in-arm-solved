Experiment 3: ARM Assembly ‚Äì Computations in ARM

</div>

<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
To (a) learn the architecture of ARM processor (b) learn basics of ARM instruction set, in particular the ARM instructions pertaining to computations (c) go through example programs and (d) write assembly language programs for the given set of (computational) problems

2 Equipments, Hardware Required

The list of equipments, components required are:

1. KEIL 5 IDE for ARM

2. Flashmagic software for programming Ùè∞éash memory 3. ARM7 hardware kit

4. USB to serial converter

5. Serial cross cable

This is purely an experiment based on emulation. (We were forced to run the lab with only emulation based experiments due to ongoing pandemic situation. The hardware details given here is to understand the context).

3 Background Information

You are strongly adviced to go through the online book by Welsh. The material presented here draws heavily from the above book.

3.1 Review of ARM Architecture

Fig below shows the internal structure of the ARM processor. The ARM is a Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) system and includes the attributes typical to that type of system:

<ol>
<li>A large array of uniform registers.</li>
<li>A load/store model of data-processing where operations can only operate on registers and not directly on memory. This requires that all data be loaded into registers before an operation can be preformed, the result can then be used for further processing or stored back into memory.</li>
<li>A small number of addressing modes with all load/store addresses begin determined from registers and instruction Ùè∞çelds only.</li>
<li>A uniform Ùè∞çxed length instruction (32-bit).</li>
</ol>
In addition to these traditional features of a RISC system the ARM provides a number of additional features:

<ol>
<li>Separate Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) and shifter giving additional control over data pro- cessing to maximize execution speed.</li>
<li>Auto-increment and Auto-decrement addressing modes to improve the operation of program loops.</li>
<li>Conditional execution of instructions to reduce pipeline Ùè∞éushing and thus increase execution speed.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>3.1.1 &nbsp;Processor Modes</li>
<li>3.1.2 &nbsp;Registers in ARM Processor</li>
</ol>
Registers The ARM has a total of 37 registers. These comprise 30 general purpose registers, 6 status registers and a program counter. Figure below illustrates the registers of the ARM. Only Ùè∞çfteen of the general purpose registers are available at any one time depending on the processor mode.

There are a standard set of eight general purpose registers that are always available (R0 Ùè∞ã R7 ) no matter which mode the processor is in. These registers are truly general-purpose, with no special uses being placed on them by the processors‚Äô architecture.

A few registers (R8 Ùè∞ã reg12) are common to all processor modes with the exception of the Ùè∞çq mode. This means that to all intent and purpose these are general registers and have no special use. However, when the processor is in the fast interrupt mode these registers and replaced with diÙè∞åerent set of registers (R8 Ùè∞çq ‚Äì R12 Ùè∞çq). Although the processor does not give any special purpose to these registers they can be used to hold information between fast interrupts. You can consider they to be static registers. The idea is that you can make a fast interrupt even faster by holding information in these registers.

The general purpose registers can be used to handle 8-bit bytes, 16-bit half-words1 , or 32-bit words. When we use a 32-bit register in a byte instruction only the least signiÙè∞çcant 8 bits are used. In a half-word instruction only the least signiÙè∞çcant 16 bits are used. Figure 3.3 demonstrates this.

The remaining registers (R13 Ùè∞ã R15 ) are special purpose registers and have very speciÙè∞çc roles: R13 is also known as the Stack Pointer, while R14 is known as the Link Register, and R15 is the Program Counter. The Ùè∞âuserÙè∞ä (usr) and Ùè∞âSystemÙè∞ä (sys) modes share the same registers. The exception modes all have their own version of these registers. Making a reference to register R14 will assume you are referring to the register for the current processor mode. If you wish to refer to the user mode version of this register you have refer to the R14 usr register. You may only refer to register from

other modes when the processor is in one of the privileged modes, i.e., any mode other than user mode. There are also one or two status registers depending on which mode the processor is in. The Current Processor Status Register (CPSR) holds information about the current status of the processor (including its current mode). In the exception modes there is an additional Saved Processor Status Register (SPSR) which holds information on the processors state before the system changed into this mode, i.e., the processor status just before an exception.

The stack pointer, SP or R13 Register R13 is used as a stack pointer and is also known as the SP register. Each exception mode has its own version of R13 , which points to a stack dedicated to that exception mode. The stack is typically used to store temporary values. It is normal to store the contents of any registers a function is going to use on the stack on entry to a subroutine. This leaves the register free for use during the function. The routine can then recover the register values from the stack 3.2. REGISTERS 27 on exit from the subroutine. In this way the subroutine can preserve the value of the register and not corrupt the value as would otherwise be the case.

The Link Register, LR or R14 Register R14 is also known as the Link Register or LR. It is used to hold the return address for a subroutine. When a subroutine call is performed via a BL instruction, R14 is set to the address of the next instruction. To return from a subroutine you need to copy the Link Register into the Program Counter. (More in Welsh).

The program counter, PC or R15 Register R15 holds the Program Counter known as the PC. It is used to identify which instruction is to be preformed next. As the PC holds the address of the next instruction it is often referred to as an instruction pointer. The name Ùè∞âprogram counterÙè∞ä dates back to the times when program instructions where read in oÙè∞å of punched cards, it refers to the card position within a stack of cards. In spite of its name it does not actually count anything!

Reading the program counter When an instruction reads the PC the value returned is the address of the current instruction plus 8 bytes. This is the address of the instruction after the next instruction to be executed2. This way of reading the PC is primarily used for quick, position-independent addressing of nearby instructions and data, including position-independent branching within a program. An exception to this rule occurs when an STR (Store Register) or STM (Store Multiple Registers) instruction stores R15 . The value stored is UNKNOWN and it is best to avoid the use of these instructions that store R15 .

Writing the program counter When an instruction writes to R15 the normal result is that the value written is treated as an instruction address and the system starts to execute the instruction at that address3 .

Current Processor Status Registers: CPSR Rather surprisingly the current processor status register (CPSR) contains the current status of the processor. This includes various condition code Ùè∞éags, interrupt status, processor mode and other status and control information. The exception modes also have a saved processor status register (SPSR), that is used to preserve the value of the CPSR when the associated exception occurs. Because the User and System modes are not exception modes, there is no SPSR available. Figure 3.4 shows the format of the CPSR and the SPSR registers.

The processors‚Äô status is split into two distinct parts: the User Ùè∞éags and the Systems Control Ùè∞éags. The upper halfword is accessible in User mode and contains a set of Ùè∞éags which can be used to eÙè∞åect the operation of a program, see section 3.3. The lower halfword contains the System Control information.

Any bit not currently used is reserved for future use and should be zero, and are marked SBZ in the Ùè∞çgure. The I and F bits indicate if Interrupts (I) or Fast Interrupts (F) are allowed. The Mode bits indicate which operating mode the processor is in (see 3.1 on page 23). The system Ùè∞éags can only be altered when the processor is in protected mode. User mode programs can not alter the status register except for the condition code Ùè∞éags.

3.1.3 Flags

The upper four bits of the status register contains a set of four Ùè∞éags, collectively known at the condition code. The condition code Ùè∞éags are:

The condition code can be used to control the Ùè∞éow of the program execution. The is often abbreviated to just hcci.

N The Negative (sign) Ùè∞éag takes on the value of the most signiÙè∞çcant bit of a result. Thus when an operation produces a negative result the negative Ùè∞éag is set and a positive result results in a the negative Ùè∞éag being reset. This assumes the values are in standard two‚Äôs complement form. If the values are unsigned the negative Ùè∞éag can be ignored or used to identify the value of the most signiÙè∞çcant bit of the result.

Z The Zero Ùè∞éag is set when an operation produces a zero result. It is reset when an operation produces a non-zero result.

<div class="page" title="Page 4">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
C The Carry Ùè∞éag holds the carry from the most signiÙè∞çcant bit produced by arithmetic operations or shifts. As with most processors, the carry Ùè∞éag is inverted after a subtraction so that the Ùè∞éag acts as a borrow Ùè∞éag after a subtraction.

V The OverÙè∞éow Ùè∞éag is set when an arithmetic result is greater than can be represented in a register.

Many instructions can modify the Ùè∞éags, these include comparison, arithmetic, logical and move instructions. Most of the instructions have an S qualiÙè∞çer which instructs the processor to set the condition code Ùè∞éags or not.

3.2 Review of ARM Instruction Sets

Why are a microprocessor‚Äôs instructions referred to as an instruction set? Because the micropro- cessor designer selects the instruction complement with great care; it must be easy to execute complex operations as a sequence of simple events, each of which is represented by one instruction from a well-designed instruction set.

Assembler often frighten users who are new to programming. Yet taken in isolation, the operations involved in the execution of a single instruction are usually easy to follow. Furthermore, you need not attempt to understand all the instructions at once. As you study each of the programs in these notes you will learn about the speciÙè∞çc instructions involved.

Table 1 lists the instruction mnemonics. This provides a survey of the processors capabilities, and will also be useful when you need a certain kind of operation but are either unsure of the speciÙè∞çc mnemonics or not yet familiar with what instructions are available.

See Chapter 4 and Appendix A in Welsh for a detailed description of the individual instructions and chapters 6 through to 12 therein for a discussion on how to use them.

The ARM instruction set can be divided into six broad classes of instruction. 1. Data Movement

2. Arithmetic

3. Memory Access

4. Logical and Bit Manipulation 5. Flow Control

6. System Control / Privileged

Before we look at each of these groups in a little more detail there are a few ideas which belong to all groups worthy of investigation.

Solve the following engineering problems using ARM through assembly programs

<ol>
<li>Compute the factorial of a given number using ARM processor through assembly programming</li>
<li>Combine the low four bits of each of the four consecutive bytes beginning at LIST into one 16-bit halfword. The value at LIST goes into the most signiÙè∞çcant nibble of the result. Store the result in the 32-bit variable RESULT.</li>
<li>Given a 32 bit number, identify whether it is an even or odd. (You implementation should not involve division).</li>
</ol>
6 Procedure

Since it is a simulation experiment, we dont need hardware. It is enough if we have a PC loaded with Keil software.

<ol>
<li>Go through Welsh thoroughly. Do all the home work ‚Äì meaning start from ARM architecture, go on till example programs. Demo all the example programs in KEIL for yourselves.</li>
<li>Write the assembly programs for the above problems (one at a time).</li>
<li>Enter the above program in KEIL software, edit and compile / assemble.</li>
<li>Run it in the ‚Äòdebug‚Äô mode to see whats happening to the registers.</li>
<li>Finally, demonstrate its working, before your TA</li>
</ol>
7 Results

Show the results to your TA. Send the code TA for evaluation
